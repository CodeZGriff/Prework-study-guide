          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Javascript makes webpage interactive</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
          <li>String - sequence of text that is enclosed in single or double quote marks</li>
          <li>Number - this is a number and doesn't have quotes around them</li>
          <li>Boolean - True/false value - special keywords that don't need quote marks</li>
          <li>Array - structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Object - can be anything, everything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>Comments - snippets of text that are added along with code, but browser ignores text marked as comments</li>
          <li>Events - code structures that listen for activity, most common is the click event, which is fired when clicking with the mouse</li>
          <li>All primitive types, except NULL and UNDEFINED, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values</li>
